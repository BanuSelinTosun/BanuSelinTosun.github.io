## Data Science Projects
  * [TakeAPic](http://takeapic.online/) 
    - January 2018 [**GitHub**](https://github.com/BanuSelinTosun/TakeAPic) on analyzing the Facial Expressions. I build an in house CNN model to classify the 7 different expressions using a 55K+ image DB. I used an Nvidia GPU along with TensorFlow, Keras, and Cuda process on AWS EC2 instance along with 400 GB attached volumes. The confusion matrix showed over 99% accuracy. The misidentified classes were sadness vs fear and anger vs surprise. 
  
  * [StreetSmart](http://www.street-smart-realty.com/)
    - September 2017 [**GitHub**](https://github.com/BanuSelinTosun/street-smart) on Real Estate housing prices. For this project, I used AWS EC2 instances to Grid Search the best regressor model with the minimum median absolute percent error. The best result achieved via Gradient Boosting Regressor with 11.3 MAPE.
