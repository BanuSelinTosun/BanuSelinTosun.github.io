## Data Science Projects

You can see my recent repo the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/BanuSelinTosun/street-smart) on Real Estate housing prices. For this project, I used AWS EC2 instances to Grid Search the best regressor model with the minimum median absolute percent error. The best result achieved via Gradient Boosting Regressor with 11.3 MAPE.
